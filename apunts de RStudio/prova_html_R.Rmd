## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{This is a try, echo=FALSE}

library(RSSL)

set.seed(1)
# Set the datasets and corresponding formula objects

datasets <- list("2 Gaussian Expected"= generate2ClassGaussian(n=2000,d=2,expected=TRUE)

# formulae <- list("2 Gaussian Expected"=formula(Class~.),
# "2 Gaussian Non-Expected"=formula(Class~.))
# # Define the classifiers to be used
classifiers <- list("Supervised" = function(X,y,X_u,y_u) {LeastSquaresClassifier(X,y)},
"Self-learning" = function(X,y,X_u,y_u) { SelfLearning(X,y,X_u,
method = LeastSquaresClassifier)})

# Define the performance measures to be used and run experiment

measures <- list("Error" = measure_error, "Loss" = measure_losstest, "Accuracy" = measure_accuracy)

results_lc <- LearningCurveSSL(as.matrix(datasets[,1:2]),dataset$Class, classifiers=classifiers,
measures=measures,type=fraction, test_fraction=0.5, repeats=3)

plot(results_lc)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
