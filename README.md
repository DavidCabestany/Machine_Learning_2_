# Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Welcome to the "Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP)" repository! This repository is dedicated to my solutions for the course focused on the study of the principal tools in a classical "data analysis pipeline" for NLP tasks. We will cover data preprocessing, feature selection, various learning scenarios, evaluation, and comparison using powerful machine learning software.

## Course Description

The machine learning discipline is rooted in artificial intelligence and statistics and involves techniques for data modeling. These models are learned from data and are commonly used for classification and/or description purposes.

In recent years, machine learning has gained exponential prominence across various application areas, including bioinformatics, industry, finance, and especially in natural language processing.

The course delves into the core tools of the data science world and explores principal classification scenarios, such as supervised, unsupervised (clustering), and weakly supervised classification. Additionally, we will cover semi-supervised classification and outlier detection, discussing their usefulness in NLP tasks.

## Syllabus

The course will cover the following machine learning tools:

1. General Terms in the "Data Science" World: Understanding the "data science" term, its relation to AI, big data, and exploring resources like Kaggle repository, kdnuggets.com, and data science for societal impact.

2. Principal Classification Scenarios: Delving into supervised classification, unsupervised classification (clustering), and alternative weakly supervised classification scenarios.

3. Semi-supervised Classification: Exploring its relevance and applications in NLP tasks. Introduction to the RSSL package in R for implementation.

4. One-class Classification and Outlier Detection: Examining their significance in NLP tasks and utilizing R packages for implementation.

5. Using Statistical Tests for Classifier Comparison: Employing software like WEKA, R, and web pages to compare classifier accuracy.

6. Feature Selection Techniques: Understanding techniques for selecting a "competitive" subset of original features.

7. General Techniques and Filters for Data Preprocessing: Utilizing preprocessing filters for various data types, including missing data imputation, one-hot encoding, discretization, handling imbalanced class distributions, etc.

8. A Short Introduction to the tm (Text Mining) Package in R: Learning how to construct a proper document-term matrix using text mining operators for subsequent machine learning analysis, starting from raw text such as files, HTML pages, tweets, etc.

9. The Machine Learning Approach: Clustering Words and Classifying Documents with R: A hands-on tutorial using R software for clustering words and classifying documents.

10. First Steps on Deep Learning for NLP by R's h2o Package (+word2vec): A practical tutorial using R software to explore deep learning with h2o package and word2vec embeddings.

While the initial five topics have a more general data-analysis orientation, the last three are tailored to your NLP interests. Nevertheless, we will strive to incorporate NLP datasets in the early topics to illustrate the use of the taught data analysis techniques in a "general purpose" setting.

## Assignments

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the assignments and practical tasks given during the course. Each assignment is organized into separate directories, and the solutions are provided in the form of code, notebooks, or reports, as applicable.

## Note

These solutions represent my own work and are provided as references and examples for fellow students. If you are currently enrolled in the same course, I encourage you to attempt the assignments independently before referring to these solutions.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions can aid your understanding of machine learning for NLP concepts and implementations, please refrain from submitting them as your own work for grading purposes. Upholding academic integrity is of utmost importance.
